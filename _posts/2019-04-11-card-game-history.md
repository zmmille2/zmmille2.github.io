I wrote a little about this a while ago in [this post](https://zmmille2.github.io/blog/2018/05/20/might-money-magic), but I wanted to delve into this topic more fundamentally, and to cover what exactly has changed as we went on.
The timeline for a lot of this is very rough, and this is mostly based on my memory.
I also reserve the right to go back and amend this to be totally accurate.
If I take out some bit that you really like, feel free to take it up with this blog's [git history](https://github.com/zmmille2/zmmille2.github.io/commits/master).

It might be useful to have an understanding of what the rules look like now.
Given this is constantly changing, I'll choose to put that at the end, and to constantly update the last paragraph.

Anyways, when we started, we had only a rough idea of what things might look like.
We actually didn't have a firm win condition for a long time.
While 

Next, we had these trap cards.

They weren't units, but they acted like units.
You could lay traps instead of playing units, but your opponents would be none the wiser.
The idea was that there might be a tile you had no interest in, but your opponents were fighting over pretty heavily.
There were a couple of problems with this.
First of all, traps couldn't win tiles.
This made buying traps pretty unattractive unless you were really kicking ass.
Players would buy traps when they were ahead and just sabatoge anyone trying to catch up.

Here's a few more.  If you've played the game, you might roughly recognize some of them.
