Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
Also, I totally stole this template (even this blog post) from [this nifty site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Worth checking out, I figured it would be a good way for me to get up and running quickly on a website, so that I can worry about more complicated stuff later, and start with a platform that I want to post to first.
