Stealing again! I'm starting to notice a theme for web development. Just steal!
Anyways, I just want to get some cool stuff on my site, and there's a ton of
other websites with cool stuff on them! Check this out, I can LaTeX on a
separate line: $$x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Or, or, or, I can do it inline, like this: $$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $$

Huh. That's weird. I got all this from a blog post, it totally lied to me.
Whatever, lol. The blog post is
[here](http://gastonsanchez.com/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/) in case
you care about that sort of thing.
