Stealing again! I'm starting to notice a theme for web development. Just steal!
Anyways, I just want to get some cool stuff on my site, and there's a ton of
other websites with cool stuff on them! Check this out, I can LaTeX on a
separate line:

$$a^2 = b^2 + c^2$$

Or, or, or, I can do it inline, like this:

$$x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
