# My Ongoing Journey to get the twitter handle I want

## Motive
As of this writing, my twitter handle is [@zmessymoney](https://twitter.com/zmessymoney).  Not the most professional thing on the market.  While it was all fun and games in high school and college, I think the time has come for me to shout into the void from a more respectable stump.  Given that, I've decided to hunt for some "Zach Miller" twitter handle, given that that's my name.  There's a few that are in my scopes.

[@zach](https://twitter.com/zach) is a non starter.  As much as I love it, the handle looks active, and I'm sure this is a highly contested name.  While it would be nice, it's a pipe dream for now.
[@zachm](https://twitter.com/zachm) is too active, but [@zachh](https://twitter.com/zachh) is a better chance.  While my last name is Miller, at least the second H is not too far off the mark.  [@zaach](https://twitter.com/zaach) is promising as well.
[@zachmiller](https://twitter.com/zachmiller) is also not likely.  Again, too active.
[@zach_miller](https://twitter.com/zach_miller) is pretty promising.  No tweets for just under a decade, doesn't look active anymore.  For now, this is the favorite.

## Approach
So, I want a twitter handle.  Big whoop.  Why should I get it?  After all, I'm sure there are plenty of people that want twitter handles they can't have.  There are [documented cases](https://www.ibtimes.com/elaborate-hack-steals-rare-twitter-handle-n-1552045) of popular twitter handles being sold, stolen, squatted, and who knows what else.

### STEP 1: OPERATION ASK NICELY

[I asked my top choice nicely if I could have the handle.](https://twitter.com/zmessymoney/status/1024702543996190722)

I doubt this will work, but if it does work, it's probably the easiest way of making it work.  I'll give him a day or two to respond, but again, I'm not hopeful here.

### STEP 2: TWITTER SUPPORT

As of December 11th, 2018, [the account that I'd like has been suspended.](https://twitter.com/zach_miller)
Unfortunately, I still can't register that account, [Twitter has a policy not to do so](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts).

This means that even if I were to contact Twitter support with another account, I'd still have to deal with this.  So I might as well consider step 3.

### STEP 3: GET A TRADEMARK

Yeah, it's ridiculous that I have to do this.
Maybe I should just get big on Mastodon or something.
Getting a trademark could cost me a couple hundred bucks.
[Plus there's this whole process you gotta go through.](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-trademark-a-name)

That's about where we're at right now.
I want the name, but unless I can find more value out of the trademark, it might be a no go.
Even if I got the trademark, there's no guarantee that I'd be able to get that name.

I could get a state level trademark: [Those only run about $55, and it might be worth a shot.](https://www.sos.wa.gov/_assets/corps/trademark-registration-fillable-form.pdf)

### STEP 3b: GET A MASTODON
