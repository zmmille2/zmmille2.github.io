# My Ongoing Journey to get the twitter handle I want

## Motive
As of this writing, my twitter handle is [@zmessymoney](https://twitter.com/zmessymoney).  Not the most professional thing on the market.  While it was all fun and games in high school and college, I think the time has come for me to shout into the void from a more respectable stump.  Given that, I've decided to hunt for some "Zach Miller" twitter handle, given that that's my name.  There's a few that are in my scopes.

[@zach](https://twitter.com/zach) is a non starter.  As much as I love it, the handle looks active, and I'm sure this is a highly contested name.  While it would be nice, it's a pipe dream for now.
[@zachm](https://twitter.com/zachm) is too active, but [@zachh](https://twitter.com/zachh) is a better chance.  While my last name is Miller, at least the second H is not too far off the mark.  [@zaach](https://twitter.com/zaach) is promising as well.
[@zachmiller](https://twitter.com/zachmiller) is also not likely.  Again, too active.
[@zach_miller](https://twitter.com/zach_miller) is pretty promising.  No tweets for just under a decade, doesn't look active anymore.  For now, this is the favorite.

## Approach
So, I want a twitter handle.  Big whoop.  Why should I get it?  After all, I'm sure there are plenty of people that want twitter handles they can't have.  There are [documented cases](https://www.ibtimes.com/elaborate-hack-steals-rare-twitter-handle-n-1552045) of popular twitter handles being sold, stolen, squatted, and who knows what else.

### STEP 1: OPERATION ASK NICELY

(https://twitter.com/zmessymoney/status/1024702543996190722)[I asked my top choice nicely if I could have the handle.]

I doubt this will work, but if it does work, it's probably the easiest way of making it work.  I'll give him a day or two to respond, but again, I'm not hopeful here.
